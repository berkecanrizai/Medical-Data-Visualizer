This projects aim is to visualize the medical data provided by the FCC to make a better understanding of the correlation between things like cholesterol, glucose, age, weight and understand the effects of cardio, alcohol intake and smoking habits between those medical observations.

Data is handled using python, pandas and graphs are made with seaborn and mathplotlib. This project is written by Berke Can Rizai for one of the end projects of Data analysis with python course.

Big part of the code can be understood clearly with the explanations in code. You are free to use and change the code however you like, it could be used in different datasheets with some changes obviously. It's not really big project however could be used as a starting point for other projects. There are two images to show what is expected result of the code so you can try with your own writing. 
You can run it directly from this link: https://repl.it/@CanRizai/fcc-medical-data-visualizer#medical_data_visualizer.py Thanks.
